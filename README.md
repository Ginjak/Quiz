# Quiz

## Description

This repository comprises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, offering users the option to choose from four available quizzes. The results are tracked and stored in local storage. Subsequently, the results can be viewed on the "Highscores" page, and users have the option to clear them if desired.

The primary goal of this project was to leverage JavaScript functionality for selecting specific quizzes, generating 10 random questions from an array, manipulating DOM elements to create, remove, show, or hide elements, as well as saving and displaying results from web local storage.
